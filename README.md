This repository contains the work developed for the consulting project with Smurfit Westrock as part of the Proyecto Intermedio de Consultoría Empresarial (PICE 202520) at Universidad de los Andes. The project aims to design and prototype a Machine Learning model capable of detecting anomalies in payment transactions from SAP data, supporting Smurfit Westrock’s internal financial monitoring processes. The work includes data consolidation, cleaning, and exploratory analysis, followed by the design and evaluation of anomaly detection models.
